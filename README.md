# YouTube Video Page Clone Project

Following up the Microverse mini-botcamp to join the coming classes **_15-08_** this is a clone YouTube video page, builds on HTML and CSS only.

If you want to see an online preview use this [Demo](https://adel-gu.github.io/youtube-vido-page/) link.
## Process

Because we always have to `trust the process`, this is what makes building this project so fun and a good learning opportunity is the following steps :

- **Build up the custom properties :**  this will make the project easy to work with and easy to maintain in the future, by declaring CSS variables.
So a good start on this is to start collecting the different colors used, Font-types, Font-sizes, Font-weights and any design pattern that is repeating a lot in the design system.
- **Utility classes :** Do you know how _bootstrap_ works? yes this is the same.
Those will make the work flow so straight forward, by creating classes for the font color, sizes , background colors ...etc.
- **The Actual classes :** Now and only now you can start getting the big picture and start thinking about the project layout and how you can achieve it, so and advice is **USE A LOT OF FLEX BOX** trust me üòÅ.

## Struggle and challenges 
Somehow this will be weird because the only thing I struggle and get  frustrated with most of the time is the naming convention for classesand variables üò•, yes this was so hard to deal with.

## Useful Links they might be helpful
- For better naming convention of color variables I used the name color plus the first to chars from the HEX code, so this link will be useful for picking colors names  [color-name](https://www.color-name.com/).
